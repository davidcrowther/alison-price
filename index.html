      <h3>Who Are We</h3>
      <p class="text-center">Have you been ‘burnt’ in the past by mindfully purchasing ‘organic’ beauty or health products that you later found out <br /> to be greenwashed or only semi-organic?</p>
      <p>I was burnt by the slick product marketing of “faux” organics and decided to do something about it. I’m Alison Price and in 2009 I started Organic Glow. My passion for organics and sharing information to empower consumers inspired me to become part of the solution... Fed up with misleading ingredient lists and unsubstantiated organic claims, I sourced the  world’s first 100% food grade certified organic skin and body care products on the planet.  Comfortable with the standards of organic food, I loved that the same rules applied for my skincare &amp; bodycare. A recognizable seal displayed on the label validated the fact that organic standards were upheld for the entire life cycle of that product.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="mb24">Maintaining the bioactive properties of the potent ingredients, the products are made fresh every 30 days and shipped direct to customers.  By way of worldwide carbon negative shipping, your products arrive at your door as fresh as the day they were made. Unrivaled purity, potency and freshness!</p>
      <p class="mb24">The world of organic products can be confusing and a little daunting. That’s why we’ve created a little ‘organic oasis’ through our Organic Glow wellness community.</p>
      <p>Our bi-monthly newsletter educates and informs readers about the latest organic solutions, and helps separate genuine information from  organic marketing hype.</p>

          <cite>My skin took a dramatic shift once I started using the Miessence products. It went from bumpy and uneven to smooth and glowing. I look forward to washing my face, moisturizing and replenishing because the benefits are so encouraging. We (me and my skin) are in love! </cite>
          <p class="name">- <strong>Amy</strong>, USA</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-3">
          <cite>The products smell gorgeous, uplift your senses and the bottom line is they work. And for an organic line they offer great value for money. The toothpaste lasts ages! I hope these large chemical cosmetic companies are feeling the threat now. Organic and chemical free is the only way forward. </cite>

        <div class="col-xs-3">
          <cite>Having suffered with a scalp rash for a year, I read that this could be caused by the parabens in shampoo. After just three treatments (ten days) with Miessence organic shampoo the rash began to reduce and after a month it has completely disappeared. I simply cannot thank you enough.</cite>

        <div class="col-xs-3">
          <cite>I cannot find another company globally that manufactures such an extensive quality range of organic and natural products. Even after 6 years of continuous use, I still love each product that I use and am living proof of the long term benefits of how they create healthy skin, hair and body. </cite>

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <ul class="faqs-list">
        <li class="with-image-left">
          <h4>How can I be sure that your products are 100% organic?</h4>
          <img src="img/cont_img_1.jpg" alt="How can I be sure that your products are 100% organic?" class="img-responsive" />
          <p>We offer over 40 products certified organic to food grade standards by USDA Organic and ACO (Australian Certified Organic) programs. All organic and purity claims are tested, monitored and verified by the USDA and/or ACO certification seals that appear on the individual products. This means raw products with NO synthetics, synthetic derivatives or synthetic processing whatsoever, meeting the most strict organic standards that exist - organic food.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="with-image-right">
          <h4>What health benefits do they offer?</h4>
          <img src="img/cont_img_2.jpg" alt="What health benefits do they offer?" class="img-responsive" />
          <p>While we cannot make any claims to health benefits, we can tell you that you will be eliminating thousands of synthetic chemicals by simply switching to certified organic products. According to the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, 89% of all commonly used cosmetic ingredients have NOT been evaluated for safety! Of those that have been tested, many have shown potential health concerns that include irritation of skin, eyes and lungs, hormone disruption, organ system toxicity and cancer links. To support your health and easily reduce the toxic load of your body, why not use organic ingredients that have been used safely internally and externally for centuries.</p>
